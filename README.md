# FreeWind

I wrote my MSc dissertation on data sources for long-term wind resource prediction using MCP.
When looking at what people had done in the past, I realised researchers had limited the number
of comparisons they had done in studies into MCP methods/data sources because they couldn't easily
automate the process.

I decided a freely available library would help the matter.

## What is FreeWind *now*

At time of writing, FreeWind is a slightly disorganised Python library, saved amongst all the other work
for my dissertation. It wraps some useful bits and pieces from projects like Scipy, implements
a few functions useful for wind energy analysis/engineering, and, most importantly, provides a framework
for testing and using MCP methods.

Once I have finished this README, I will start adding parts of the project in pieces, refactoring and
restructuring as I go.

## What will it be (Roadmap?)

In the first place, the code needs tidying and testing. Further MCP methods need implementing, and the
existing ones need documenting.

More ambitiously, I would like it to be developed into a larger library of open source tools for wind energy
researchers and professionals to make scripting repetitive tasks convenient.

Finally (long-term goal), I would love to see FreeWind used as the foundation for a freely available GUI for
all sorts of wind energy applications.

## What other free software is available for renewable energy?
